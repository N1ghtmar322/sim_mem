two main functions:
1.load - loads a page to memory and return a certain address value.
2.store - loads a page to memory and change the given address value.

==Program Files==
mem_sim.c- the file contain only functions
mem_sim.h- an header file ,contain structs, declarations of functions.
main.c- contain the main only.

Makefile-to compile the program.
==How to compile?==
compile: gcc mem_sim.h mem_sim.c main.c -o ex4 -Wall
run: ./ex4

==Input:==
no input

==Output:==
print functions, memory load
